This file is for those who want to build their own Line-based chatbot using python programming language. Please play with this open repository to make more useful stuff together.

Currently, i am trying to implement BERT base_model on a service conversation. I will post the codes and colab link at the end of this project. 
 To do:
### 1. Clean code

DONE

### 2. Play with the training code (on Google Colab): DONE
