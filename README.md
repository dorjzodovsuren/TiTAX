Currently, i am trying to implement BERT base_model on a service conversation. I will post the codes and colab link at the end of this project. 
 To do:
### 1. Clean the code

### 2. Play with the training code (on Google Colab):

- [Pytorch_vision_transferlearning_vgg16.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8DdUfmcpAEEdp4hc1GysumJs3fEsMq2)  [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8DdUfmcpAEEdp4hc1GysumJs3fEsMq2)


### 3. Add Colab repo about fine-tune BERT base model in conversation model
### 4. Add the code explanation blog on the Medium at the end of this repo.
