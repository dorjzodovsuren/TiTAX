Currently, i am trying to implement BERT basic model in conversation model. I will post the code and colab link at the end of this project. 
 To do:
 1. Clean the code
 2. Add Colab repo about how to train inception in image recognition task

 3. Add Colab repo about fine-tune BERT base model in conversation model
 4. Add the code explanation blog on the Medium at the end of this repo.

### 2.c. Play with the _notebooks_ dynamically (on Google Colab) :boom:

Anyone can use the [colab.research.google.com/notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook) website (by [clicking](XXX) on the icon above) to run the notebook in her/his web-browser.
You can then play with it as long as you like, for instance by modifying the values or experimenting with the code.
